 ## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Then run ```npm run db``` to start json server database on [http://localhost3001](http://localhost:3001)

You can modify db.json file to directly change database, after refresh your app because i get data in a component server
